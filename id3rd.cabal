synopsis:            Read ID3 tag frames from an MP3 file.
description:
        This tool reads ID3 tag frames from an MP3 file,
        outputting them in a way that preserves maximal
        useful information and is formatted for easy use in
        scripts. It supports the subset of tag frames parsed
        by the `idiii` package. Large blobs generally are
        not parsed and reported in detail.
